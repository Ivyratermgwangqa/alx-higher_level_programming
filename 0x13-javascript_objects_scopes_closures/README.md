# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures

This repository contains a set of JavaScript tasks related to objects, scopes, and closures. Each task is implemented in its respective JavaScript file.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Rectangle #0 (0-rectangle.js)
An empty class `Rectangle` is defined using the class notation.

### Task 1: Rectangle #1 (1-rectangle.js)
A class `Rectangle` is defined with a constructor that initializes width and height attributes.

### Task 2: Rectangle #2 (2-rectangle.js)
A class `Rectangle` is defined with a constructor that initializes width and height attributes. The constructor also checks for valid values and creates an empty object if values are not valid.

### Task 3: Rectangle #3 (3-rectangle.js)
A class `Rectangle` is defined with a constructor, and an instance method `print` is added to print a rectangle using the character 'X'.

### Task 4: Rectangle #4 (4-rectangle.js)
A class `Rectangle` is defined with a constructor, and instance methods `print`, `rotate`, and `double` are added. These methods print the rectangle, rotate it, and double its dimensions, respectively.

### Task 5: Square #0 (5-square.js)
A class `Square` is defined, inheriting from the `Rectangle` class from Task 4. It has a constructor that takes a size and initializes the dimensions.

### Task 6: Square #1 (6-square.js)
A class `Square` is defined, inheriting from the `Square` class from Task 5. It includes an instance method `charPrint` to print the square using a specified character.

### Task 7: Occurrences (7-occurrences.js)
A function `nbOccurences` is defined to return the number of occurrences of a given element in a list.

### Task 8: Esrever (8-esrever.js)
A function `esrever` is defined to return the reversed version of a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.

### Task 9: Log me (9-logme.js)
A function `logMe` is defined to print the number of arguments already printed along with the new argument value.

### Task 10: Number conversion (10-converter.js)
A function `converter` is defined to convert a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument.

### Task 11: Factor index (100-map.js)
A script is created to import an array and compute a new array using the `map` function. The new array is computed by multiplying each value of the initial list by its index.

### Task 12: Sorted occurrences (101-sorted.js)
A script is created to import a dictionary of occurrences by user id and compute a dictionary of user ids by occurrence. The new dictionary has keys as numbers of occurrences and values as lists of user ids.

## How to Run

To run any of the JavaScript files, use the following command:

```bash
node filename.js
```

Make sure to replace `filename.js` with the name of the JavaScript file you want to execute.

## Coding Style

The code follows the [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard) style guide with additional rules from the AirBnB style guide.
