   - Description: Writes an object to a text file in JSON representation.
   - Script: [5-save_to_json_file.py](5-save_to-json_file.py)

7. **Create Object from JSON File (6-load_from_json_file.py)**
   - Description: Reads a JSON file and creates an object from it.
   - Script: [6-load_from_json_file.py](6-load-from-json-file.py)

8. **Class to JSON (8-class_to_json.py)**
   - Description: Converts a class object to a dictionary for JSON serialization.
   - Script: [8-class_to_json.py](8-class_to-json.py)

9. **Student Class to JSON (9-student.py)**
   - Description: Defines a Student class and provides a method to convert it to a JSON representation.
   - Script: [9-student.py](9-student.py)

10. **Student Class to JSON with Filter (10-student.py)**
    - Description: Extends the Student class to allow for filtering which attributes to include when converting to JSON.
    - Script: [10-student.py](10-student.py)

11. **Student Class to Disk and Reload (11-student.py)**
