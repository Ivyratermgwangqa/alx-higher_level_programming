# 0x09 Python - Everything is Object

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate how everything in Python is an object, including variables, data types, and objects themselves.

## Files

- `0-answer.txt`: Contains the name of the function used to get the type of an object. (Answer: `type`)
- `1-answer.txt`: Contains the name of the function used to get the variable identifier (memory address) in CPython. (Answer: `id`)
- `2-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether variables `a` and `b` point to the same object (No).
- `3-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether variables `a` and `b` point to the same object (Yes).
- `4-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether variables `a` and `b` point to the same object (Yes).
- `5-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether variables `a` and `b` point to the same object (No).
- `6-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet printing the equality of two strings (`s1` and `s2`) (True).
- `7-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet checking if two variables (`s1` and `s2`) are the same object (True).
- `8-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet checking the equality of two strings (`s1` and `s2`) (True).
- `9-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet checking if two variables (`s1` and `s2`) are the same object (True).
- `10-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet checking the equality of two lists (`l1` and `l2`) (True).
- `11-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet checking if two variables (`l1` and `l2`) are the same object (False).
- `12-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet checking the equality of two lists (`l1` and `l2`) (True).
- `13-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet checking if two variables (`l1` and `l2`) are the same object (True).
- `14-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet demonstrating list behavior when an element is appended.
- `15-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet demonstrating list behavior when concatenating lists with `+`.
- `16-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet demonstrating integer incrementation behavior.
- `17-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet demonstrating list incrementation behavior.
- `18-answer.txt`: Contains the output of a code snippet demonstrating list assignment behavior.
- `19-copy_list.py`: Contains a Python function `copy_list` that returns a copy of a list.
- `20-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether `a` is a tuple (Yes).
- `21-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether `a` is a tuple (Yes).
- `22-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether `a` is a tuple (No).
- `23-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether `a` is a tuple (Yes).
- `24-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether two variables `a` and `b` point to the same object (No).
- `25-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether two variables `a` and `b` point to the same object (No).
- `26-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether two variables `a` and `b` point to the same object (Yes).
- `27-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether the last line of a script prints `139926795932424` (No).
- `28-answer.txt`: Contains the answer to whether the last line of a script prints `139926795932424` (Yes).
- `100-magic_string.py`: Contains a Python function `magic_string` that returns a string based on the number of times the function is called.
- `101-locked_class.py`: Contains a Python class `LockedClass` that prevents the dynamic creation of new instance attributes except for `first_name`.

## Tasks 1-28
The tasks include answering questions about Python object behavior and understanding the concepts of object equality and identity.

## Task 29 - Copy a List
This task involves creating a Python function called `copy_list` that returns a copy of a list. The function can be used to create a new list that is a copy of an existing list.

## Task 30 - Tuple or Not?
In this task, you need to determine if a given variable is a tuple or falset.

## Task 31 - Tuple or Not?
This task is similar to Task 30 but with a different variable. You need to determine if a given variable is a tuple or falset.

## Task 32 - Tuple or Not?
Similar to the previous tasks, you need to determine if a given variable is a tuple or falset.

## Task 33 - Tuple or Not?
Again, you need

 to determine if a given variable is a tuple or falset. This time, it's a different variable.

## Task 34 - Clear Strings
In this task, you need to count how many string objects are created and deleted when variables are created and deleted.
