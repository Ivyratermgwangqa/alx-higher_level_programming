# 0x02. Python - import & modules

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various programming concepts.

## add_0.py

This script defines a function `add(a, b)` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum. It also demonstrates how to import and use this function in another script.

## use_add_0.py

This script imports the `add` function from the `add_0.py` file and demonstrates how to use it to perform the addition of two numbers. It prints the result of adding 1 and 2.

## calculator_1.py

This script defines several mathematical functions. The `use_calculator_1.py` script imports these functions and demonstrates how to perform mathematical operations using them.

## use_calculator_1.py

This script imports functions from the `calculator_1.py` file and showcases how to perform various mathematical operations using these functions. It defines two variables `a` and `b` to use as arguments for the mathematical operations.

## print_args.py

This script prints the number of arguments passed to it along with their values. It demonstrates how to access command-line arguments using the `argv` list.

## add_args.py

This script calculates and prints the sum of all the arguments passed to it. It casts the arguments into integers using the `int()` function before performing the addition.

## print_hidden_names.py

This script reads the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc` and prints all the names defined in it. It ensures that only names not starting with `__` are printed.

## use_variable_load_5.py

This script imports the variable `a` from the `variable_load_5.py` file and prints its value.
